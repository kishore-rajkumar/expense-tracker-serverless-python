# MVP Requirements Summary: End-to-End Serverless Application

## 1. Project Overview

Develop a serverless web application that enables users to submit, process, and view data via a modern, cloud-native architecture. The application will leverage fully managed serverless services for scalability, cost efficiency, and ease of maintenance.

---

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 User Interface (Frontend)
- Responsive web UI for:
  - User authentication (sign up, login, logout)
  - Data submission form (simple structured input)
  - Viewing a list of previously submitted data with details
- Real-time feedback and error handling for user actions

### 2.2 API Layer (Backend)
- RESTful API endpoints for:
  - User registration, authentication, and session management
  - Data submission (persisting user input)
  - Retrieval of user-submitted data

### 2.3 Data Processing
- Basic data validation and transformation on submission
- Asynchronous processing using managed event-driven compute (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)
- Storage of processed data/results

### 2.4 Data Storage
- User profile and authentication data in a managed identity service
- Submitted and processed data stored in a managed NoSQL cloud database (e.g., DynamoDB, Cosmos DB)

### 2.5 Security & Compliance
- User authentication and authorization (OAuth2, OpenID Connect, or equivalent)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure storage of sensitive information
- Audit logging for key actions

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability:** Application must automatically scale with user demand using serverless infrastructure
- **Availability:** High availability via managed cloud services (target 99.9% uptime)
- **Performance:** API endpoints must respond within 1 second under typical load
- **Cost Optimization:** Pay-per-use design, no reliance on provisioned servers/VMs
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Centralized monitoring and error logging via cloud-native tools
- **Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns and modular architecture

---

## 4. Technology Stack (Examples, can be finalized)

- **Frontend:** React.js (with Vite or Next.js)
- **Authentication:** Amazon Cognito or Auth0 (or equivalent)
- **API Layer:** AWS API Gateway + AWS Lambda (Node.js/Python), or Azure API Management + Azure Functions
- **Database:** AWS DynamoDB or Azure Cosmos DB
- **Hosting:** AWS Amplify, Vercel, or Azure Static Web Apps
- **Infrastructure-as-Code:** AWS SAM/CloudFormation or Azure Bicep/ARM templates

---

## 5. Out of Scope for MVP

- Complex data analytics or reporting
- Multi-tenant or enterprise-level access controls
- Third-party integrations
- Mobile native app

---

## 6. Deliverables

- Source code repository with all application and infrastructure code
- Deployment scripts and documentation
- Basic test suite for core flows
- User documentation (setup, usage, troubleshooting)

---

## 7. Success Criteria

- Users can register, submit data, and view their submissions via the web UI
- Application runs completely serverless, with no managed servers/VMs
- End-to-end deployment can be achieved using provided scripts and documentation
