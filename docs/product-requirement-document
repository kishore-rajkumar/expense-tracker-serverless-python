As your **Business Analyst/Product Owner**, here’s how I would start shaping and clarifying the vision for your new **expense-tracker-serverless-python** project:

***

**Business/Project Vision**

- Build a **production-ready SaaS expense tracker** for individuals or small businesses needing simple, secure expense management.
- Use **AWS serverless architecture** to deliver low-cost, scalable, and maintainable operations.
- Showcase best practices that **future employers, clients, or recruiters** can immediately recognize as “production-level.”

***

**High-Level Product Goals**

- **Seamless User Experience:** Fast registration/login (AWS Cognito), intuitive expense add/view dashboards.
- **Reliable Data Storage:** All expenses securely in DynamoDB; receipts in S3 with organized bucket structure.
- **Automated Workflows:** Use Step Functions for status updates, e.g., approval, receipt verification, monthly summaries.
- **Security First:** Real IAM policies for least-privilege access; practical model for multi-user, per-user isolation.
- **Robustness:** Monitoring (CloudWatch), error handling everywhere, end-to-end tests to ensure zero downtime and traceable issues.
- **Scalability & Maintainability:** Each AWS service integrated for instant scaling and easy debugging.

***

**Initial User Stories (MVP)**

- *As a new user,* I want to register and log in securely to start tracking expenses.
- *As a logged-in user,* I want to add expenses, view my expense list, and upload receipts.
- *As a user,* I want to update/delete an expense and check its status easily.
- *As a user,* I want to view/download my receipts anytime.
- *As an admin/owner,* I want automatic monthly reports via Step Functions.
- *As a developer,* I want clear documentation and test coverage for all core business logic.

***

**Technical Acceptance Criteria**

- **Domain-driven design:** Clear separation between core business logic (expense domain), infrastructure (AWS services), and presentation (API interface).
- **Auth patterns:** AWS Cognito with proper group/role policies, practical examples for public vs. private routes.
- **Monitoring/logging:** CloudWatch integration, per-request logging with error/trace support.
- **Error handling:** Each Lambda/API returns useful errors and log traces; failed workflows can be retried or escalated.
- **Tests:** End-to-end tests, covering authentication, CRUD, and workflows.

***

**Next Steps Recommendation**

1. **Write/Refine User Stories:** Start small—registration, add/view expense, upload receipt.
2. **Define Data Models:** Expense entity, receipt object, user profile.
3. **Design Basic IAM Policies:** Draft for Lambda/API/S3/DynamoDB integration.
4. **Feature Roadmap:** What’s in scope for MVP? What’s “showcase only” (e.g., advanced analytics, report automation)?
5. **Architecture Diagram:** Visual map for README; helps developers and employers instantly grasp your architecture.
6. **Project Documentation:** Set standards for writing code, tests, and usage guides from day one.
