# MVP Requirements Summary: End-to-End Serverless Application (Python Backend)

## 1. Project Overview

Develop a serverless web application enabling users to submit, process, and view data using Python-based backend/serverless compute. The project is designed both as a cloud-native product and as a hands-on demonstration of tech lead experience in a corporate environment.

---

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 User Interface (Frontend)
- Responsive web UI for:
  - User authentication (sign up, login, logout)
  - Data submission form (simple structured input)
  - Viewing a list of previously submitted data with details
- Real-time feedback and error handling for user actions

### 2.2 API Layer (Backend, Python)
- RESTful API endpoints developed in Python for:
  - User registration, authentication, and session management
  - Data submission (persisting user input)
  - Retrieval of user-submitted data

### 2.3 Data Processing
- Data validation and transformation in Python on submission
- Asynchronous processing via event-driven Python serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)
- Storage of processed data/results

### 2.4 Data Storage
- User and auth data in managed identity service
- Submitted and processed data in a managed NoSQL cloud database (e.g., DynamoDB, Cosmos DB)

### 2.5 Security & Compliance
- User authentication/authorization (OAuth2, OpenID Connect, or equivalent)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure storage of sensitive data
- Audit logging for key actions

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability:** Leveraging serverless for auto-scaling
- **Availability:** High-availability via managed services (target 99.9% uptime)
- **Performance:** API endpoints respond within 1s under normal load
- **Cost Efficiency:** Pay-per-use, no provisioned servers/VMs
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Centralized via cloud-native tools
- **Maintainability:** Modular, clear separation of concerns

---

## 4. Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js (with Vite or Next.js)
- **Authentication:** Amazon Cognito or Auth0
- **API Layer & Serverless:** AWS Lambda (Python), API Gateway (REST)
- **Database:** AWS DynamoDB
- **Hosting:** AWS Amplify or Vercel
- **IaC:** AWS SAM or CloudFormation (YAML/JSON)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (with code review workflows)
- **Monitoring:** AWS CloudWatch

---

## 5. Tech Lead & Team Experience Objectives

- **Architecture:** Lead selection and documentation of cloud/serverless architecture (Python focus)
- **Task Planning:** Break down requirements into team tasks, track progress, and manage delivery
- **Mentorship:** Guide team in Python best practices, AWS Lambda development, and DevOps
- **Code Quality:** Set up and enforce code review, automated testing, and CI/CD standards
- **Collaboration:** Use GitHub Projects/Issues to manage sprints, priorities, and feedback
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Document technical decisions, challenges, and solutions for team learning and transparency
- **Stakeholder Communication:** Present architecture, progress, and MVP outcomes to stakeholders

---

## 6. Out of Scope for MVP

- Advanced analytics/reporting
- Multi-tenancy or complex RBAC
- Third-party business integrations
- Native mobile clients

---

## 7. Deliverables

- Source code repository (Python backend, frontend, infra-as-code)
- Deployment scripts & documentation
- Test suite for core user flows
- Documentation:
  - Setup/usage/troubleshooting
  - Architecture and tech lead approach
  - Team/leadership retrospectives

---

## 8. Success Criteria

- Users can register, submit data, and view submissions via web UI
- All backend/serverless logic is implemented in Python
- Application is fully serverless, deployed end-to-end via scripts
- Team collaboration, code quality, and tech leadership practices are clearly documented and demonstrated
