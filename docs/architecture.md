## Architecture Overview

This diagram illustrates the AWS serverless architecture designed for a scalable and secure expense tracking application.

### Components and Data Flow:

- **Clients (Web/Mobile App):**
  - Users initiate requests such as adding expenses or uploading receipts.
  - They interact with the app interface which communicates via HTTP requests.

- **API Gateway:**
  - Acts as the front-door for all incoming requests.
  - Routes requests to appropriate Lambda functions after performing validation and throttling.
  - Manages API-level security, rate limiting, and request shaping.

- **AWS Cognito (Authentication & Authorization):**
  - Handles user sign-up, login, and token management.
  - Verifies user identity and issues JWT tokens for secure access.
  - Ensures only authenticated users can access protected resources.

- **AWS Lambda (Business Logic):**
  - Executes core application logic, such as CRUD operations on expenses.
  - Processes receipt uploads and metadata management.
  - Interacts with DynamoDB and S3 to store and retrieve data.

- **Amazon DynamoDB (Data Storage):**
  - Stores expense records, user profiles, and metadata.
  - A fast, scalable NoSQL database optimized for serverless apps.

- **Amazon S3 (File Storage):**
  - Stores receipt images and documents.
  - Receipts are uploaded here and referenced via URLs stored in DynamoDB.

- **Amazon CloudWatch (Monitoring & Logging):**
  - Collects logs from Lambda and API Gateway.
  - Provides metrics, dashboards, and alerts to monitor system health and troubleshoot issues.

## Summary

This architecture ensures a highly scalable, cost-efficient, and secure expense tracking system, leveraging AWS serverless services to reduce operational overhead, enhance performance, and facilitate future growth.

## Next Steps

- Configure IAM roles and policies for secure access.
- Implement the Lambda functions and API routes.
- Set up Cognito user pools and identity management.
- Connect all components and test end-to-end workflows.
