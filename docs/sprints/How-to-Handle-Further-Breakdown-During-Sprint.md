# How to Handle Further Breakdown During Sprint
- **Create new issues:** For each newly identified smaller task, create separate GitHub issues linked to the parent subtask or epic. This keeps your work granular and trackable.
- **Use checklists in the original subtask:** You can list these new smaller subtasks as checklist items inside the original subtask issue. Mark them off as you complete those detailed steps.
- **Update sprint board:** Add the new issues/checklist items to your sprint board or project tracker to maintain visibility and proper status management.
- **Communicate changes:** If you’re working with others, note the change in your issue comments or sprint notes to keep everyone aligned.
  ​
# Why This Works Well
- Refining tasks mid-sprint prevents bottlenecks caused by underestimated complexity.
- Smaller tasks make progress and blockers clearer.
- Tracking detailed subtasks as separate issues improves history tracking for review and retrospectives.

# Practical Example
- **Original subtask:** “Implement JWT token generation”
- During the sprint, you realize you need to break it down further into:
  - “Research JWT libraries in Python”
  - “Write token generation function”
  - “Add expiration and refresh token logic”
  - “Write unit tests for token functions”

---
Create these as new GitHub issues and add them as checklist items in the original subtask issue. Progress through them individually while keeping the original subtask updated.

This flexible approach keeps your sprint organized and helps maintain momentum without losing detail.
