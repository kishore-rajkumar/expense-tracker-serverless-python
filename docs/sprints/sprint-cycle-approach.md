## 1. Before the Sprint Starts
- **List all sprint tasks:** Write down every backlog item, user story, or feature you plan to complete during this sprint. Break down big tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.
- **Clarify expectations:** Make sure each item has a clear definition of “done”—for example, “user can sign up with email/password and receives a confirmation email.”
- **Set up your tracking tool:** Use a simple Kanban board (GitHub Projects, Trello, or even a to-do list) to track To Do, In Progress, and Done tasks.

## 2. Sprint Kickoff
- **Prioritize tasks:** Decide the order—typically start with tasks that are foundational (e.g., setting up basic authentication before user profile screens).
- **Create a sprint branch:** In your Git repo, create a sprint-specific branch from develop (e.g., sprint-01/feature-auth).

## 3. Daily Workflow (Micro-Standup)
- **Pick a task:** At the start of each work session, choose the next most important task and mark it In Progress.
- **Set a small, clear goal:** Focus on finishing the chosen task (or a subtask) by the end of your session.
- **Document issues:** If you hit a blocker, jot down a note in your issue tracker and move to another task if needed.

## 4. Coding/Execution
- **Work in increments:** Commit code frequently with meaningful messages (“fix: correct token validation logic”).
- **Write/update tests:** Add or update unit tests and integration tests as you progress on each feature.
- **Sync up tracking:** After finishing a task, mark it Done and move the next item into In Progress.
 
## 5. End of the Sprint
- **Review deliverables:** Check each completed task against its “done” criteria.
- **Demo your work:** Run your application and manually test key features or endpoints delivered in the sprint.
- **Sprint retrospective:**  
  Ask yourself -
  - What went smoothly?
  - What was unexpectedly hard?
  - What will you do differently in the next sprint?

## 6. Prepare for Next Sprint
- **Update the backlog:** Add any new issues discovered, mark incomplete items for the next sprint, and prioritize.
- **Refine your workflow:** Adjust your tracking method, branch names, or task granularity based on what you learned.
