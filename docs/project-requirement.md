# Requirements Document: Serverless SaaS Expense Tracker (Python/AWS)

## 1. Business/Project Vision

- **Goal:** Build a production-ready SaaS expense tracker for individuals or small businesses needing simple, secure expense management.
- **Architecture:** Use AWS serverless (Python backend) for low-cost, scalable, and maintainable operations.
- **Showcase:** Demonstrate best practices that employers, clients, or recruiters recognize as “production-level”—including design, code quality, DevOps, and leadership.

---

## 2. High-Level Product Goals

- **Seamless User Experience:** Fast registration/login (AWS Cognito), intuitive expense add/view dashboards.
- **Reliable Data Storage:** Expenses securely stored in DynamoDB; receipts in S3 with organized bucket structure.
- **Automated Workflows:** AWS Step Functions for status updates (approval, receipt verification, monthly summaries).
- **Security First:** Real IAM policies for least-privilege and per-user data isolation.
- **Robustness:** Monitoring (CloudWatch), comprehensive error handling, and end-to-end tests for zero downtime and traceable issues.
- **Scalability & Maintainability:** Each AWS service integrated for instant scaling and easy debugging.

## 3. MVP Features
**Essential for First Release:**

1. **User Registration & Login** (with secure authentication)
2. **Add Expense** (amount, date, category, notes)
3. **View Expenses** (list with filter/search by date, category)
4. **Edit/Delete Expense**
5. **Expense Categories** (predefined and user-customizable)
6. **Basic Dashboard** (summary: total expenses, category breakdown)
7. **Multi-Tenancy Support** (each user’s data is strictly isolated)
8. **Responsive Web UI** (works well on desktop and mobile browsers)

**Must-have Reporting, Integrations, or Mobile Support:**
- **Reporting:** Download/export expenses as CSV (must-have for both individuals and small businesses).
- **Integrations:** None required for MVP, but architecture should allow for future integration (e.g., email receipts, invoicing, or accounting APIs).
- **Mobile Support:** Responsive PWA (Progressive Web App) for now—native mobile apps can be future enhancements.

## 3. Initial User Stories (MVP)

- As a new user, I want to register and log in securely to start tracking expenses.
- As a logged-in user, I want to add expenses, view my expense list, and upload receipts.
- As a user, I want to update/delete an expense and check its status easily.
- As a user, I want to view/download my receipts anytime.
- As an admin/owner, I want automatic monthly reports via Step Functions.
- As a developer, I want clear documentation and test coverage for all core business logic.

---

## 4. Technical Acceptance Criteria

- **Domain-driven design:** Clear separation between core business logic (expense domain), infrastructure (AWS services), and presentation (API interface).
- **Authentication:** AWS Cognito with group/role policies and examples for public vs. private API routes.
- **Monitoring/logging:** CloudWatch integration, per-request logging, and error/trace support.
- **Error handling:** Lambda/API returns useful errors and log traces; failed workflows can be retried or escalated.
- **Testing:** End-to-end tests covering authentication, CRUD, and workflows.

---

## 5. Leadership & Team Objectives

- **Architecture & Decisions:** Document rationale for service and design choices.
- **Task Planning:** Break down requirements, manage team roles, and track progress.
- **Mentorship:** Guide team in Python, AWS Lambda, and serverless best practices.
- **Collaboration:** Use GitHub Projects/Issues, code review, and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Documentation:** Maintain clear technical and user-facing documentation throughout development.
- **Stakeholder Communication:** Regular progress updates, clear articulation of challenges and solutions.

---

## 6. Next Steps

1. **Refine User Stories:** Start with registration, add/view expense, upload receipt.
2. **Define Data Models:** Expense entity, receipt object, user profile.
3. **Design Basic IAM Policies:** Draft for Lambda/API/S3/DynamoDB integration.
4. **Feature Roadmap:** Clearly state what’s in scope for MVP and what’s “showcase only.”
5. **Architecture Diagram:** Visual map for README and onboarding.
6. **Project Documentation:** Set standards for writing code, tests, and usage guides from day one.

---

## 7. Out of Scope for MVP

- Advanced analytics/reporting dashboards beyond monthly summary.
- Multi-tenancy or complex RBAC.
- Third-party business integrations.
- Native mobile clients.

---

## 8. Deliverables

- Source code repository (Python backend, frontend, infrastructure-as-code).
- Deployment scripts and documentation.
- Test suite for core flows (authentication, CRUD, workflows).
- Architecture diagram and technical documentation.
- Team/leadership retrospectives (optional, for portfolio).
