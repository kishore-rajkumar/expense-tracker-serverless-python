## 1. Break Down Requirements Into GitHub Issues & Epics
- Create epics (e.g., “User Management”, “Expense CRUD”, “Receipt Storage”, etc.) and break them into actionable issues/tasks.
- This enables team task assignment, progress tracking, and transparency.

## 2. Design Initial Data Models & API Contracts
- Define the core data entities (Expense, Receipt, User) and relationships.
- Draft API interface contracts (request/response schemas for each endpoint).
- This reduces rework and aligns backend/frontend expectations.

## 3. Draft Architecture Diagram & Folder Structure
- Visualize the AWS serverless components and their interactions.
- Propose a codebase folder structure (e.g., backend/, infrastructure/, docs/).
 - This guides implementation and onboarding.

## 4. Write Initial Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for AWS Resources
- Set up the AWS baseline: Cognito, DynamoDB, S3, Lambda, API Gateway using IaC (e.g., AWS SAM, CDK, or Serverless Framework).
- This enables repeatable, reviewable, and auditable cloud setup.

## 5. Draft IAM Policy Matrix & Example Policies
- Specify fine-grained IAM roles/policies for all actors/services.
- Prevents security issues and aligns with least-privilege best practices.

# 6. Document Coding/Testing/Review Standards
- Set up guidelines for code style, branching, PR reviews, and mandatory tests.
- Ensures consistent, high-quality code and easier collaboration.

## 7. Implement Authentication & Core CRUD Flows First
- Develop and test the registration/login flows and basic expense CRUD.
- Prove out the core business logic and integration points.

## 8. Integrate Monitoring, Logging, and Error Handling
- Add CloudWatch integration, per-request logging, and error tracing.
- This provides observability and reliability from the start.
